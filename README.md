# Introduction

When you're knee-deep in Python code, comprehensive documentation can be a lifesaver (but, admittedly, the last thing 
you want to write). It's an important part of programming, and Python, being a highly readable and straightforward 
language, places great emphasis on it. One key component of python documentation is the docstring.


# Common Python Docstring Formats

* ### EpYtext Docstring Format (EpYtext)
* * Less structured, easy to read and write, good support in Epydoc.
* ### Google Docstring Format (Google)
* * Less structured, easy to read and write, good support in various tools.
* ### ReStructuredText Format (reST)
* * Highly structured, great for complex projects, excellent support in Sphinx.
* ### NumPy/SciPy Docstring Format (NumPy/SciPy)
* * Highly structured, great for scientific projects, excellent support in Sphinx.
